# HSharp
My Custom Programing Language

---
## What is This Project?
As a programmer I have always wanted to make a programming language. Though it may not be very complicated, this my best attempt at my very own programming language.

## Prerequisites
This entire language created in python, because of this it's very important that you have python installed on your system.

## How To Use
I tried to make this as simple as possible and have included a batch file that acts like an executeable for the language in it's current state. Simply double click on the batch file and enjoy!

## Credits
- All of this wouldn't be possible without CodePulse's tutorial series (Most of my current code is just from the tutuorial but over time will expand to be more of my own) which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePulse
